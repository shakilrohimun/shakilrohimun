## About Me

I am currently a **Quantitative Consultant at FBH Associés**, working on advanced financial modeling and quantitative research projects.  
Before joining FBH Associés, I led an **internal project at Zodiak Conseil** as project manager, where I developed a **neural network–based pricing methodology for Bermudan swaptions**.  

At FBH Associés, I have worked with the **Council of Europe Development Bank (CEB)** within the **Market Risk and Capital Management Department**, focusing on the **calibration of a Global Stochastic Equilibrium (GSE) model**.  
I am currently assigned to the **Caisse des Dépôts et Consignations (CDC)** in the **ALM Risk Department**, where I contribute to **dividend flow modeling**.  

In the near future, I aim to pursue a **CIFRE PhD** in **Quantitative Finance, Stochastic Modeling, or Artificial Intelligence** to bridge academic research and real-world financial applications.

## Projects

This GitHub includes a selection of academic and professional projects that can be publicly shared.  
They were developed during my **Master’s in Quantitative Finance at Université Paris-Saclay**, and include both **code implementations** and **technical reports (PDFs)** demonstrating theoretical and numerical applications across finance, econometrics, and machine learning.
